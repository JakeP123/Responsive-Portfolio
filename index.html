      <p class="pp">My name is Jake Phillips, and I am a 30 year old married man. I currently go to Rutgers
            Coding Bootcamp while also in only the 3rd month of starting my new company. As you can imagine
            things are very busy in my life. When im not working or coding I am spending time with my wife and
            my dog, Mojo. Mojo is a 110lb Italian Mastiff and is the only "child" we have for now.</p>

      <p class="pp">Some interesting things to know about me is that I have moved from the East Coast to the
            West Coast and BACK to the East Coast two separate times in the last 5 years. The reason I moved so
            much, was for work of course.
</p>

      <p class="pp">Before I started my new company, I was a minority owner in a large
            international lighting distribution company, "Quoizel Lighting". You may of seen our brand in Lowe's
            when shopping for decorative lighting.</p>
